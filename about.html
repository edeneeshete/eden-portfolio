          <h2>About</h2>

          <p>
            I’m a Melbourne-based designer and media graduate with a strong interest
            in editorial design, experimental publishing, and web-based outcomes.
            My work explores how visual language, narrative, and structure can
            work together to create thoughtful, human-centred design.
          </p>
          <p>My media degree has trained me to approach projects with a strong awareness of branding and marketing. I have developed an understanding of how design, campaigns, and language work together to communicate effectively and resonate with audiences. This background informs the way I think about messaging, visual identity, and strategic design decisions.</p>
          <p>
            I’m particularly drawn to projects that sit between disciplines. As a Media graduate, and a writer, moments where writing, image-making, and interaction inform one another are of particular interest. Whether working in print or digital spaces, I approach design as a system that balances clarity with expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently expanding my practice by learning Touch Designer and exploring 3D animation. These skills allow me to push the boundaries of my design work and develop new ways to create immersive, dynamic experiences. I am interested in how moving image, interaction, and spatial design can extend the impact of my work and broaden the way I approach visual storytelling.
          </p>

          <p>
            This portfolio brings together selected university-led and independent
            projects, reflecting my ongoing interest in design as both a visual
            and conceptual practice.
